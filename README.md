# Malaria cell type detection
I have used ResNext50 model for classifying malaria parasite infected and uninfected cells.
Though I have used the data from Kaggle, the original data source is https://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/repositories/malaria-datasets/
Also see for ref. https://github.com/caticoa3/malaria_hero
